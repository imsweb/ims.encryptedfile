# ims.encryptedfile

This package uses the 7zip CLI to password protect a file with AES256 encoding.

TODO - plone.namedfile throws a warning about file size with large files. Need to determine if this is actually a problem.

## Dependencies

This package works with ims.upload although it is not required. If using ims.upload, it must be >=2.4.
